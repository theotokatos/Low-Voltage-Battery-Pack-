This repository contains the design of a low voltage battery pack developed for a Formula SAE electric vehicle. The pack uses 21700 lithium-ion cells arranged in a 2P8S topology, with a maximum system voltage of 33.6 V. The battery system was designed and built in compliance with the German Formula SAE (FSAE) electrical regulations. All electrical connections between cells were performed in-house using spot welding. The battery casing is manufactured from ABS material rated UL94 V-0. The system integrates a custom-designed BMS featuring passive cell balancing.
